                    higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot
                    reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike
                    most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including
                    adjacent foes).
                    Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.
                    You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop
                    the whip to avoid being tripped.
                    When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including
                    the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).
                    You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength
                    modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.

                    thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you
                    must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal
                    creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does
                    not provoke attacks of opportunity.
                    A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil
                    outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage
                    from the splash.

                    particular area or subject.

                    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
                    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are
                    in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in
                    each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell
                    effect.)
                    Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal
                    weaker auras.
                    Aura Strength: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster
                    level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.
                    Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell)
                    or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a
                    location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the
                    aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

                    the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell
                    duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
                    The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to
                    each creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or

                    You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you

                    toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t
                    your turn.

                    area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can’t move that
                    round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the

                    mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and
                    over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors,
                    drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or
                    drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is
                    not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that
                    requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can’t be
                    used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.

                    caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or
                    even into yourself.
                    You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus,
                    and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special
                    attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form
                    does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).
                    You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any
                    from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.
                    If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting
                    ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is,
                    speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use
                    somatic or material components.
                    You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities
                    include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming,
                    and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement),
                    natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial
                    bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities,
                    and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous
                    two-weapon attacks) than normal.
                    You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under
                    physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing,
                    regeneration, scent, and so forth.
                    You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the
                    new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You
                    cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn’t change the
                    creature type or subtype.
                    You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture,
                    and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form’s significant
                    physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must
                    fall within the norms for the new form’s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of
                    the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your
                    Disguise check.
                    When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it
                    is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.
                    When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the
                    same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you
                    wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that
                    you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion
                    are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from
                    the whole reverts to its true form.

                    smoke, depending on the version you choose.
                    Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.
                    This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds
                    (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance
                    can prevent blindness.
                    Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The
                    cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even
                    darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to
                    Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud
                    dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.
                    Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so
                    large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not
                    extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster
                    level.

                    anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself
                    and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a
                    creature in a web won’t cause you to become entangled.
                    Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds,
                    the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than
                    normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move
                    from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25
                    Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check
                    or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly.
                    Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist
                    check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
                    If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at
                    least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.
                    The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a
                    hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.
                    All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
                    Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not
                    destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

                    also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
                    You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to

                    at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead
                    through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged
                    touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
                    The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low
                    melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an

                    the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if
                    the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.

                    If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject’s immediate surroundings
                    (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows
                    at a speed of up to 150 feet.
                    As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any
                    magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating
                    through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.
                    If the save succeeds, you can’t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.
                    Arcane Material Component: The eye of a hawk, an eagle, or a roc, plus nitric acid, copper, and
                    zinc.
                    Wizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not

                    objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or
                    conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
                    Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who
                    believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.
                    Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to
                    recognize its true nature.
                    Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save.
                    Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved
                    attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless
                    of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the
                    spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration’s level (4th)
                    rather than the spell’s normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows
                    spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have
                    normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
                    Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
                    A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of
                    whether it’s recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and
                    weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow
                    creature’s damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal
                    damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.)
                    Furthermore, the shadow creature’s AC bonuses are one-fifth as large.
                    A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed
                    on vague, shadowy forms.
                    Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

                    miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as
                    their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or
                    smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per
                    three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two
                    Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another,
                    and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range
                    is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance
                    applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws
                    and spell resistance.
                    You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental
                    image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make
                    teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
                    To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the
                    following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
                    Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
                    “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been
                    there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one
                    hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very
                    familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
                    “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise
                    familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be
                    familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table,
                    rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be
                    off target from.
                    You appear where you want to be.
                    You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off
                    target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined
                    randomly
                    You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.
                    Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
                    spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.
                    Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points
                    of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.
                    Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

                    data-content="A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he
                    knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing,
                    reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least
                    10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the
                    spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.
                    Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per
                    day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus
                    spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: The Bard indicates that the bard gets 0
                    spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based
                    on his Charisma score for that spell level.
                    The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells
                    of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: The
                    Bard. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma
                    score; the numbers on Table: The Bard are fixed.)
                    Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can
                    choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard &quot;loses&quot;
                    the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the
                    spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell
                    the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether
                    or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
                    As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any
                    time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.

                    those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the
                    category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all
                    be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling,
                    playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each
                    ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to
                    qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does
                    not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
                    Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require
                    concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.

                    to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the
                    creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For

                    use of this ability.
                    To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected

                    attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits
                    quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play
                    and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4
                    penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat
                    requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a
                    DC equal to the new Perform check result.
                    Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at

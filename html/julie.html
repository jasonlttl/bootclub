                    understandable.

                    particular area or subject.

                    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
                    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are
                    in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in
                    each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell
                    effect.)
                    Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal
                    weaker auras.
                    Aura Strength: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster
                    level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.
                    Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell)
                    or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a
                    location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the
                    aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

                    minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can
                    color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of
                    nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
                    Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created
                    by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or
                    spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.

                    monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a
                    full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.
                    When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons

                    special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a

                    attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can’t use any weapon other than
                    a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.

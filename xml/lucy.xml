                <name>Rage (Ex)</name>
                <text>A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian
                    temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will
                    saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the
                    barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage
                    when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way
                    temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or
                    Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the
                    Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells
                    or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell
                    completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item
                    creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the
                    character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the
                    end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2
                    penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current
                    encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies).
                    A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability
                    once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per
                    day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a
                    barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else’s action.

                <text>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack,
                    she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
                    The rogue’s attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC
                    (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target.
                    This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.
                    Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.
                    Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
                    With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal
                    damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal
                    damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.
                    A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes,
                    plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to
                    critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well
                    enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack
                    while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are
                    beyond reach.

                    <text>A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.
                        This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her,
                        unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.
                        If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains
                        improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
                        to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

                    <name>Special Abilities</name>
                    <text>On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue
                        gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
                        Crippling Strike (Ex)
                        A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken
                        and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength
                        damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for
                        each damaged ability.
                        Defensive Roll (Ex)
                        The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise
                        would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat
                        (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll
                        with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage
                        dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes
                        full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her
                        defensive roll—if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability. Since
                        this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the
                        rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
                        Improved Evasion (Ex)
                        This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a
                        successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed
                        save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
                        Opportunist (Ex)
                        Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just
                        been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue’s attack
                        of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can’t use the
                        opportunist ability more than once per round.
                        Skill Mastery
                        The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even
                        under adverse conditions.
                        Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence
                        modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and
                        distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability
                        multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.
                        Slippery Mind (Ex)
                        This ability represents the rogue’s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would
                        otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment
                        spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same
                        DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

                <text>The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several
                    effects.
                    When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is
                    holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers
                    appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that
                    provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to
                    cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)
                    A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any
                    condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge
                    bonuses.
                    All of the hasted creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and
                    swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of
                    movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping
                    distance as normal for increased speed.
                    Multiple haste effects don’t stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

                <text>Protection from energy grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast
                    it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of
                    energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.
                    Note: Protection from energy overlaps (and does not stack with) resist energy. If a character is
                    warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its
                    power is exhausted.

            <text>During your action, you designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against
                attacks from that opponent. You can select a new opponent on any action.
                A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge
                bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.

            <text>When you use the attack action or the full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of as much
                as –5 on your attack roll and add the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class.
                This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last
                until your next action.
                Normal: A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight defensively while using the attack or
                full attack action to take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

                also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

                    an adjacent foe.
                    You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can
                    drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.

                <text>You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow
                    while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires
                    a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the
                    strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on
                    attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use
                    with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of
                    an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to
                    the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp
                    to its cost.
                    For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a
                    longbow.

                    attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
                    A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the
                    flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the
                    target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action
                    to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames
                    requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save.
                    Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.
